Project for gameplay

Hello, and welcome to my research project for gameplay programming.

In this project, I'm gonna guide you through my first time making something with AI in unity.
During gameplay programming, we saw steering behaviours, behaviour tree, finite state machine, but for this project, I decided to keep it simple.
My main focus was towards creating funny behaviour and learning about how a navmesh works in Unity, and how you need to redesign certain script to make it more usable for gameobjects.

I chose to create a small ecosystem. My ecosystem is a peaceful grassland with some puddles, where rabbits try to survive by paying attention to their hunger, thirst, and of course, procreating.
